It designs, manufactures and sells data technology products, including data storage devices, data center systems and cloud storage services.","message":"Oh Western Digital, The chances we give you, but the continuous egotistical behavior shown indicates you don't even care about the well being of your company in the slightest. Even the largest companies would want to know every detail they can about what was taken, but Western Digital didn't even bother to contact us. I am confused by this because we offered to give them file trees of everything, as all groups do when extorting their victims. But as stated they did not even contact. How sad, but I cannot say I'm surprised. At the helm of this company you have a corrupt former Cisco Executive. We thought after our interview with TechCrunch maybe they'd come to do some exploring to find out what data was taken, though. If you are investing in this company-- I would advise encouraging the leadership to at least find out what was taken.\n\nPlease do not feel sorry for these hounds. I can assure you that they are far more corrupt than you realize, and we have evidence to support our assertions. It's approaching fast. But, we are not superior to them. We apologize but we won't divulge if they pay. \n\nImportant documents will be released while priceless artifacts will be sold. At this moment, nothing has been sold or leaked. Despite our attempts over the past two weeks, Western Digital has not responded to any of our contact attempts. Even the most naive organizations would want to know precisely what was taken, this situation demonstrates the lack of corporate governance. Have a look at how far we were able to travel through their network, for example. They are corrupt and disregarded everything, thinking nothing would happen. News flash: When they filed Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, they misrepresented several details regarding our intrusion, purposefully. \n\nIt appears there is additional speculation. No worries everyone we will clean it up. We have their firmware too.\n\nWe will fuck you until you cannot stand anymore Western Digital. Consider this our final warning.\n","logo":{"id":"/article-attachment/f1925505-d08c-4f42-a524-a55e6bef52ba/f6f28b8a-4de6-4ff7-806d-b354c6ea3a7d","title":"redacted","dt":1681778219131},"attachments":[],"fileHosts":[]},"createdDt":1681778207935},{"id":"8b721468-c4d6-45e3-b316-c3ddad98e904","title":"Leadway Assurance Company Limited","previewContent":"blank","content":null,"publication":{"url":"https://www.leadway.com","country":"unknown","description":"Leadway Assurance Company Limited has been hacked.
