The storage of company data, personal data, sensetive data of partners is at a critically low level. The same is true for internal processes, policies and production - absolutely all of them are not properly executed and controlled. Döhler puts its customers, information, processes and consequently the consumers of their products at risk.\n\nThe company has been hacked. The data is encrypted and stored on our servers. At this time we have information that will open the public's eyes to restricted data and help change the way millions of people around the world think about their products:\n\n- Detailed information about product formulations and manufacturing methods\n- Financial records of the company and its partners\n- Information about the company's lonistic chains and contractors\n- Information on so-called supplier farms, detailing the company's methods of working with them\n- Critical personal data about Döhler employees and management\n- Information on Döhler product technologies and solutions\n- Databases, backups\n- Industry data and analytics\n- Hygiene and production control data\n- Strategic company and customer data\n- Information that can change the way people around the world think about Döhler products\n\nWe fully understand that the bigger a company is, the harder it is to keep all processes safe, however in the case of Döhler we have a company which treats its processes and partners without any responsibility. Döhler's extremely low level of security will make all its customers aware of the serious risks of doing business with Döhler. \n\nThe irresponsible storage of partner and customer data (including product recipes, closed patents, NDA documentation, financial documents, business methods) will entail their disclosure and downloading into the public domain. These documents will be available to anyone who wishes to access them.\n\nDöhler may not understand the complexity of this incident, so the company's global divisions will face serious consequences if they fail to cooperate. A large number of journalists from all over the world will be involved in the incident with full access to the downloaded company data.\n\nAll of the personal data of the company's clients and its employees will be used for criminal purposes, all of these people will have a huge number of problems with the law through the fault of the company. And the company itself would be in direct violation of the fundamental conventions of the International Labor Organization and the GDPR personal data law.\n\nIf Döhler fails to come forward to resolve this incident within 48 hours - it will be seen as a gross violation of the rights of its customers and consumers, who have a right to know the truth about the food they eat and the approach to its production. Millions of people will know the truth about the food they buy every day in supermarkets and eat in fast-food restaurants of world-famous brands.
