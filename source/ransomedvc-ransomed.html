Within my investigation i have found that 6 people affiliated with me (may) have been arrested, in this way i am putting an end to this. the profit we made isnt worth the ruining of the lifes of any of our affiliates, all of our 98 affiliates are now officially fired, we are sorry for the not so long operation of the group but it happened to be that some of the kids cant have a normal opsec, i cannot do anything about it, i earned good with them but using newly born kiddies at the age of ~20 is just not right in my eyes, they will end up in prison anyways but i do not wish to continue all of this that will support their stupidness, we do not regret any of our breaches nor ransoming any of our "customers" and "clients". We have done more than anyone else within such a small period of time but this is because we used to hire anyone at any age without any particular skills within his opsec, its mostly their fault but i do not want them to use my project(s) as a podium to get caught. Have fun little haxxors, Cheers!
